Hello, I’m Alberto, I was born in ‘90 in Palermo, Italy, 
where I studied statistics until 2013.  
Then, in 2015, I moved to Padua continue my studies and 
since 2017 I’m in Rome to work as Data Scientist, maybe *Number Cruncher* atm.  
I always want to improve my skills in (not only) related-fields of my profession but, 
you know, there’s a big difference between willing and doing.
